Developed using virtualenv.

You can probably find virtualenv in the repository for your linux system.
It's in Arch's repos and Ubuntu's.

Once installed, from the app's root directory run `virtualenv env`.

This will create an `env` directory.

You can then run `source env/bin/activate` to activate your virtual environment for python.
To deactivate the virtualenv, simply run `deactivate`.

While "activated" you can run `pip install my_super_cool_python_package` and it will install to your
project instead of globally to your system.  For more information on virtualenv, check out this helpful
article I found on the interwebs: https://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/
